See the Badge beside each phase name for the weighting of the assignments during that phase.</p> <p>In the first phase we are trying to really get to the root of the problem that is needed to be solved for the client.</p> <p>In the second phase we are designing the interface and optimizing what will become the user experience in the app.</p> <p>The third phase is all about doing the development work of turning the designs and prototypes into a functioning app, while doing iterative development and testing.</p> <p>The final phase is about wrapping up the final development on the required features, working on a deployment plan, documentation, and handing the completed project off to the client.</p> <h2 id="course-outline"><a href="#course-outline" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Course Outline</h2> <p><a href="/mad9145-w20/2019-2020_mad9145.pdf">MAD9145 Course Outline PDF</a></p> <h2 id="team-identity"><a href="#team-identity" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Team Identity</h2> <p>Your first deliverable is the <a href="/assignments/identity.html">Team Identity</a> assignment.

This policy should cover things like responsibility for assignment submissions, communication with clients and each other, attendance at team meetings, attendance at team work sessions, turn around time for required work, and so on.</p> <h3 id="course-unexcused-absence-policy"><a href="#course-unexcused-absence-policy" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Course Unexcused Absence Policy</h3> <p>These are the penalties for missing a class, missing a status meeting, missing a client meeting or showing up more than 30 minutes late for any of these.</p> <p>If you are going to be late or absent, you MUST let your team leader know BEFORE the start time of the event.</p> <ul><li><span class="badge tip" style="vertical-align:top;" data-v-85f8d686>1st</span>: Warning

These meetings will be held in the DARE District in room C270. Each team will have a 30 minute window for their meeting.</p> <p>Some of these meetings will be where you submit deliverables. Some will give you an opportunity to ask questions that are specific to your team's project.</p> <p>Attendance at these meetings is required for all team members.</p> <p>We will randomly select the time slot for each team using this:
